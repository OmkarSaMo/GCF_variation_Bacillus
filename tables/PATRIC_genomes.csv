As sequence-known DNA is the least requirement for the method, among dozens of sequence-known bacteria available in 1997 when the project started, the Synechocystis PCC6803 strain was indeed the only choice in terms of non-pathogenic, safe and sound bacterium. The chimera genome strain BEST7613 has raised a number of issues previously poorly argued. Growth in a media suited for Synechocystis, complete synthetic media for photosynthesis with no carbon sources has not been achieved yet and therefore cultivated in B. subtilis growth media all the time. Given gene expressions from the Synehocystis genome expressed properly and coordinately, conversion of cellular gene regulatory networks from that of B. subtilis to the other partner is expected. A number of factors and components, including the cellular membrane structure inside and outside, cell wall, and metabolic state have to be converted from B. subtilis in response to changes in the culture medium remained to be examined.

Biocontrol is a promising technique being cost effective, environment friendly and able to target pathogens difficult to control through traditional means. Bacteria that are associated with plant roots and exert beneficial effects on plant development are known as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Compared to plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas rhizobacteria, Bacillus species are advantageous due to their ability to form spores, which enable survival at high temperature, extreme pH, drought or mechanical and chemical stress and thus ideal for use as commercial biocontrol products. A PGPR may serve both as a biofertilizer and as a biological antagonist to pathogens. PGPR can be used for seed treatment supporting colonization in the rhizosphere on emerging roots. The mechanisms of protection may vary among different bacteria and include alteration of plant cell walls, production of biofilm on plant roots that prevent infection, competition for nutrients and space for growth and production of antibiotics and other damaging compounds to the pathogens. The Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain UCMB-5036 has potential to serve as a biocontrol agent.

The chimera genome strain BEST7613 has raised a number of issues previously poorly argued. Growth in a media suited for Synechocystis, complete synthetic media for photosynthesis with no carbon sources has not been achieved yet and therefore cultivated in B. subtilis growth media all the time. Given gene expressions from the Synehocystis genome expressed properly and coordinately, conversion of cellular gene regulatory networks from that of B. subtilis to the other partner is expected. A number of factors and components, including the cellular membrane structure inside and outside, cell wall, and metabolic state have to be converted from B. subtilis in response to changes in the culture medium remained to be examined.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: ?Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. ?Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). ?Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Identifying specific antibiotic resistant microbes is essential for quick and appropriate treatment. Increased antibiotic resistance in the environment may limit treatment options for infections. As the climate changes and permafrost thaws, antibiotic resistant microbes may multiply at an increased rate. Multidrug resistance genes are often found on plasmids, enabling the rapid sharing via horizontal gene transfer. Using culture-based methods, we found widespread antibiotic resistance along with heavy metal tolerance in local boreal forest soils affected by thawing permafrost. We sequenced our cultured bacteria using Oxford Nanopore MinION to generate long-reads. We assembled and polished our genome followed by annotation. We identify individual resistance genes present in our samples.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

We also use Illumina data from individual strains and the full community to generate and help validate assemblies for the reference community.

With funding support from FDA?s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:ZYMO RESEARCH<Smith, N. R.

There is a duplicated pathogenicity island that has also been detected in strain LVS and mutations in the iglA, iglC, or pdpD genes affect the ability of the pathogen to survive in macrophages. The genome also contains genes for type IV pili production and capsular polysaccharide genes similar to those of Bacillus anthracis as well as numerous ABC transporters.

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology.

In this study, a novel PCP-degrading Bacillus cereus was isolated from wastewater and characterized for PCP degradation PCP in a batch reactor. Degradation kinetics were elucidated via substrate inhibition models, while PCP transformation was established by spectrophotometric and GC-MS analysis. The isolate shared 95% sequence homology with Bacillus cereus XS2 and is closely related to some B. cereus strains previously reported for the degradation of PCP and other related pollutants. The isolate degraded 74% of PCP (within 9 days at initial PCP concentration of 350 mg l-1) and other congeners in batch culture of, both singly and in co-metabolism. The degradation followed first and zero-order kinetics at low and high PCP concentration, respectively with biokinetic constants: maximum degradation rate (0.0996 mg l-1 h-1); substrate inhibition constant (723.75 mg l-1); half-saturation constant (171.198 mg l-1) and R2 (0.98), suggesting the possibility of using this isolate for bulk degradation of PCP. PCP-degrading genes (cpsABCDE) and cytochrome p450 were amplified from the genome of the organism. Two different PCP degradation pathways were proposed based on the identified metabolites and genes amplified. Cloning and expression of the catabolic genes are underway to map out the concise pathway for PCP transformation by this isolate.",sample_type:Cell culture,98,96.7,,,,Good,2020-03-27T14:29:39.635Z,2020-03-27T14:29:39.635Z

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

This study explored cultivable microbial diversity in various anaerobic enrichment cultures from rock cores recovered during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357 from the Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 30??N), which hosts Lost City serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal field. Here, we report the first successful enrichment and isolation of anaerobic bacteria from subseafloor rocks. 16S rRNA-gene analyses showed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated microbial communities enriched at 10?25??C and marine pH 8.5. Drastic differences in cultivable microbial diversity were observed depending on incubation pressure: atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) or hydrostatic pressures mimicking the in-situ conditions (8.2 and 14 MPa). Bacteria belonging to known genera Tessaracoccus, Citrobacter, Proteiniclasticum, Tissierella and Bacillus were isolated at 0.1 MPa, while isolation of a novel anaerobic bacterium was made possible at 14 MPa from core sample M0070C-3R1 (-1150 mbsf). This strain designed 70B-AT is a mesophilic, moderately halotolerant and piezotolerant chemoorganotroph able to use yeast extract, tryptone, glycerol, mannitol, pyruvate and a large range of carbohydrates as carbon sources. Genomic analysis supported a heterotrophy lifestyle. We propose the name ?Petrocella atlantisensis? for this novel species of a novel genus within the newly described family ?Vallitaleaceae? (order Clostridiales, phylum Firmicutes).",,93.9,92.2,,,,Good,2019-02-01T09:37:54.364Z,2019-02-01T09:37:54.364Z

The project study was conducted to identify parasporin genes and in vitro anticancer activity of parasporal proteins of Bt strains identified from different regions of Bangladesh. Bacillus thuringiensis strain BD59S produces three different sizes parasporal proteins and trypsinized active cry proteins from this Bt strain showed strong cytotoxic activity against the HeLa cell line.

This organism, also known as BT, is famous for the production of an insecticidal toxin. The bacterium was initially discovered as a pathogen of various insects and was first used as an insecticidal agent in the early part of this century. This organism, like many other Bacilli, is found in the soil, where it leads a saprophytic existence, but becomes an opportunistic pathogen of insects when ingested. The specific activity of the toxin towards insects and its lack of toxicity to animals has made this organism a useful biocontrol agent.  The delta-endotoxin, which is produced during the sporulation part of the life cycle, causes midgut paralysis and disruption of feeding by the infected insect host. The presence of a parasporal crystal, which is outside the exosporium of the endospore, is indicative of production of the toxin, and serves as a marker for this species.Activation of the toxin typically requires a high pH environment such as the alkaline environments in insect midguts followed by proteolysis. Binding of the toxin to a receptor on intestinal epithelial cells serves to position the toxin to insert itself into the apical membrane where it forms a pore. The flux of water and ions into the cytoplasm results in eventual lysis leading to tissue damage. Various toxin genes specific for a variety of insects have been studied, and many are now being used in genetically modified plants which have been engineered to produce the toxin themselves, eliminating the need to produce sufficient amounts of B. thuringiensis spores.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. konkukian serotype H34 strain 97-27.

The distribution of SNPs across the BCG lineages allowed clustering of these strains to generate a linear phylogeny and refining the previous genealogies of BCG strains.

B. thuringiensis YBT-1520 is higher toxic to lepidopteran pests than the standard strain HD-1 and other Bt biopesticide strains and has been used to produce the MIAN FENG biopesticide (Chinese patent no. ZL 95 106749.4). The project for sequencing the B. thuringiensis YBT-1520 genome started in 2000 by our lab, the Institute of Plant Protection from Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and BGI HangZhou. During the years we prepared the plasmids (2kb and 5kb), BAC (50-100kb) and fosmid libraries with the complete genome DNA of B. thuringiensis YBT-1520. The random clones from the libraries were sequenced using Megabace 1000 and ABI 3730 automated sequencers at BGI HangZhou. The results were analyzed using ABI sequencing analysis software, and assembled using the Phred/Phrap/Consed package at the Institute of Plant Protection. The coverage was 10x with approximately 110,000 reads (average length 525bp). Thanks for the cooperation with these 2 institutes mentioned above, we have got a high quality draft genome of B. thuringiensis YBT-1520. And then by PCR walking to close the gaps, we completed most of all the plasmids sequences in this strain. In 2008, we restart the genome project via the next high-thought sequencing technique. The whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing was performed: 1) coverage of 1000x with the 75bp length PE reads (Illumina GA technology) at BGI Shenzhen, China; 2) coverage of 14x with the 375bp length PE reads (Roche GS FLX technology) at W.M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. We have sorted the scaffolds of chromosome referring to the completed Bc group chromosomes via the genome alignment software MAUVE (asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/). And we finished the last gaps, almost among the scaffolds of the total plasmids, with the analysis of the reads and PCR. The whole completed genome sequences are exactly consistent with the corresponding draft genome sequences.",,99.8,97.5,100,2.5,,Good,2016-01-17T15:35:11.421Z,2016-01-17T15:35:11.421Z

It has been isolated from pneumonic lungs (Harhay et al., 2015), udder and spleen (Blackall et al., 2002) of cattle. It has also been isolated from bovine meninges and was identified as the cause of fatal bovine meningitis (Catry et al., 2004). However, little is known about this pathogen and its ability to cause disease. So far, there are complete genome sequences available for only four M. varigena isolates which were all isolated from lung necroscopies taken from cattle with shipping fever and sequenced using the PacBio SMRT platform (Harhay et al., 2014). In the current study we used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies nanopore platform to sequence a bovine milk isolate that was identified by a veterinary diagnostic laboratory as Mannheimia haemolytica in March 2017. DNA was extracted and a sequencing library was generated directly (without fragmentation) from 1 ???g of the extracted bacterial DNA using the 1D??? Sequencing Kit (R9.5) (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The library was run on a FLO-MIN107 SpotON flowcell on a MinION Mk1B Nanopore sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) using MinKnow (v1.7.14) software (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) on a lap top (Dell Latitude E6540, 64 bit). Approximately 200,000 sequence reads of up to 400 kb were generated. CANU was used to assemble these long reads into a single contig of 2.18 Mbp. This is the first Mannheimia varigena bovin milk isolate to be fully sequenced.Blackall PJ, Bisgaard M, Stephens CP. 2002.
